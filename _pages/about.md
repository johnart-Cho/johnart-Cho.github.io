Hi, I'm applied research scientist at [SOCAR](https://www.socar.kr/), the largest car-sharing platform in the Republic of Korea.

I recently finished my MS major in computer science and engineering at Hanyang University, advised by Professor [Yong Suk Choi](http://ai.hanyang.ac.kr/member). Before my MS, I comleted my BA in computer science and engineering at [Hanyang University](http://cs.hanyang.ac.kr/).

My research interests are sLLM, PEFT(parameter efficient fine-tuning), prompt engineering.
